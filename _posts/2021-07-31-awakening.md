## Getting the bug
I remember the first time I stumbled across an awareness of something far more powerfull than my point and click experience.  As part of my development plan at work, I had begun learning more and more about data visualization and story telling with data.  It was the first time in a long time I was consuming books about work and business related activities. As is often the case when one pursues knowledge, I started to run into questions and gaps.  Then I stumbled across a chapter in a book about data journalism, in which the author states "I would really recommend you pick up a bit of code if you want to play with data.  It really opens a lot of doors."  My initial thought was is he serious? Why would you need code to play around in a BI engine or fiddle with a few excel sheets.  Then he went on to describe web scrapping, and I saw the light.  There began a journey that may never end, and I am not sure I want it too anyway.

## Self Taught
Given my fully employed status and family life, I chose to go the self taught route.  It has been rewarding, confusing and frustrating.  I do try to force some code into my work life whenever possible, but it has proven more difficult than I would have anticipated.  I generally have to make up reasons to fire up and IDE and hack away at something.  Most of my experience has been simple scripts or more focused data analysis efforts (more work friendly).  One of the more significant challenges is moving along the spectrum from a tinkering mindset with simple one time use scripts to a formal IDE with version control and full environment set up.  And to get to a production level product is mind boggling.  The amount of freely available material to learn to tinker is as plentiful as grains of sand on the beach.  As you move up the spectrum to formal development concepts it starts to dwindle, and it is hard to understand where to invest your time.  I continue to chip away, but the process is slow.  There are just too many road maps, and none of them seem to clearly indicate the outcome.
