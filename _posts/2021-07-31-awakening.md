## Memories
I remember the first time I stumbled across an awareness of something far more powerfull than my point and click experience.  As part of my development plan at work, I had begun learning more and more about data visualization and story telling with data.  It was the first time in a long time I was consuming books about work and business related activities. As is often the case when one pursues knowledge, I started to run into questions and gaps.  Then I stumbles across a chapter in a book on data journalist, in which the author states "I would really recommend you pick up a bit of code if you want to play with data.  It really opens lots of doors."  My initial thought was is he serious? Why would you need code to play around in a BI engine or fiddle with a few excel sheet.  Then he went on to describe web scrapping, and I saw the light.  There began a journey that may never end, and I am not sure I want it too anyway.
