## Getting the bug
I remember the first time I stumbled across an awareness of something far more powerfull than my point and click experience.  As part of my development plan at work, I had begun learning more and more about data visualization and story telling with data.  It was the first time in a long time I was consuming books about work and business related activities. As is often the case when one pursues knowledge, I started to run into questions and gaps.  Then I stumbled across a chapter in a book about data journalism, in which the author states "I would really recommend you pick up a bit of code if you want to play with data.  It really opens a lot of doors."  My initial thought was is he serious? Why would you need code to play around in a BI engine or fiddle with a few excel sheets.  Then he went on to describe web scrapping, and I saw the light.  There began a journey that may never end, and I am not sure I want it too anyway.
