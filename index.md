### Opening Comments
This is the first time I am attempting to put anything out into the world, so prepare to be underwhelmed.  It is a journey I never knew existing, but one which has nevertheless captured my imagination and my attention wholeheartedly.  Come along as I journal my way through the effort to become computer literate in the 21st century.  No mistaking that comment, it is my expectation that everyone will learn some amount of computational thinking and coding as technology continues to grow is footprint in our lives.
